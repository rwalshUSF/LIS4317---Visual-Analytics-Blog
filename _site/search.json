    "text": "This is my sixth post for my LIS4317 Visual Analytics blog. Welcome!\nHere is the .png image of the visualization:\n\nFor this assignment, I chose to use the “mtcars” dataset in RStudio because I’ve always found automotive data engaging and informative. As I explored the dataset, I focused on variables that could help visualize both comparisons and deviations—specifically using miles per gallon (mpg) as a central metric. I created a bar chart to highlight how each vehicle’s mpg compared to the dataset’s mean mpg. This allowed me to spot clear differences in fuel efficiency among vehicles and identify which cars performed above or below the average benchmark. The bar chart revealed that mpg values ranged from about -9.69 to +13.81 from the mean, indicating a notable divergence among the vehicles. This highlighted differences between groups of vehicles, from full size larger vehicles having less mpg and smaller compact vehicles having higher mpg. This also, sheds some light on differences between another variable, “cyl,” which would show that 4 cylinder vehicles get better gas mileage than 8 cylinder vehicles, and that 6 cylinder vehicles perform at around the average if included in a multivariate analysis.\nWhile the visualization did effectively expose trends in fuel efficiency, it posed a few challenges during creation. Reordering the x-axis by mpg values and flipping the coordinates to make vehicle names more readable required extra effort. It was particularly tricky to ensure the bars were sorted in descending order based on their deviation from the mean, with the vehicle furthest below average at the bottom. According to the principles discussed by Few (2009) “Deviation analysis doesn’t require fancy visualizations. The two best graphs for displaying deviations are bar graphs and line graphs.” (p. 204) and Yau (2011) “Across two variables, it is a little more difficult, but it’s still doable” (p. 228), my chart generally aligned with good data visualization practices—particularly in clarity and the effective use of categorical and quantitative variables. However, some fine-tuning was necessary to meet the principles of intuitive design and visual hierarchy, which made the process both insightful and a valuable learning experience.\nReferences:\nFew, S.

    "text": "This is my fourth post for my LIS4317 Visual Analytics blog. Welcome!\nHere is a link to my visualization in Tableau Public:\nhttps://public.tableau.com/views/Module_04/Sheet1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link\nThis is the .png image of the visualization:\n\nI selected the following variables to include in my analysis:\n\nRail(T/F)\nPrimary UZA Population\nYear\nMonth\nTotal Collisions\nTotal Derailments\nTotal Events\nTotal Fatalities\n\nThe reasons I selected these variables are as follows:\nI selected the variables Rail (T/F), Primary UZA Population, Year, Month, Total Collisions, Total Derailments, Total Events, and Total Fatalities to create a time series visualization in order to analyze patterns and trends in rail-related incidents over time. Including Year and Month allows for analysis over time and adding month gave me the option to zoom in on the data if necessary, which could be helpful for identifying seasonality, long-term trends, or sudden changes. The Rail (T/F) variable helped me differentiate between incidents involving rail systems and those that do not, providing a foundation for further comparative analysis if necessary. Primary UZA Population adds a demographic dimension, to explore how population size could possibly correlate with the frequency or severity of collisions. The collision related variables; Total Collisions, Total Derailments, Total Events, and Total Fatalities help analyze the scale and impact of safety issues, helping to assess events over time. Together, I think these variables provide data for an in depth analysis/understanding of rail safety trends over time.\nThe data reveals interesting patterns and information including a consistent increase in both collisions and fatalities over time, indicating a growing safety concern. Notably, 2020 saw a temporary drop in collisions, likely due to reduced rail traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this decline, fatalities continued to rise that year, suggesting that the severity of incidents may have intensified."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is my second post for my LIS4317 Visual Analytics blog. Welcome!\nThe assignment required me to perform a search using ‘Google Dataset Search’ using keywords that interest me, ensuring that the dataset included a column of complete street addresses. I chose the following keywords for my search:\n‘Hillsborough County Public School Locations’\nI chose these keywords because I wanted to create a map of Hillsborough County Public Schools that shows the zip codes with the most and least schools within them.\nHere is the dataset that I chose to use:\nhttps://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/hillsborough::schools/explore\nI was then required to open the dataset .csv file and save it as a ‘Google Sheet’ that would be saved on my ‘Google Drive.’\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12fRF6A_MnygfVKmYrZZjixUTxyqHJ8d5q1VuxemOheA/edit?gid=70990919#gid=70990919\nI then signed up and downloaded the free version of ‘Tableau Public’ and connected to my Google Drive. Doing so allowed me to utilize the dataset within Tableau to create an interactive geographical map that displayed the various zip codes in Hillsborough County, Florida, along with their boundaries and a heat map showing the number of schools operating within each zip code. Here is the map image:\nClick on the image to view it in full size!\n\nI faced several challenges during the process, including adding spreadsheet columns to the ‘Marks’ in Tableau and exporting the worksheet as a .png image file. I was able to research ways to drag the columns in Tableau to the various options for the ‘Marks’ and found that creating the map with ‘zipcode’ and ‘details’ worked well. I then added a label for each zip code and chose a ‘Filled Map’ style to highlight the boundaries and patterns for Hillsborough County zip codes. I was also able to research ways to export a worksheet and learned that I was not able to export the worksheet to an image from the desktop application. I needed to publish/save the project to Tableau Public online to export the map to a .png image file on my local hard drive.\nSome additional graphical elements or Gestalt principles that I applied to the finished map to improve clarity and insight were:\n\nAdjust point size and color scale. By making the font on the title and zip codes a little bigger and bold, I was able to capture the viewers attention and communicate the purpose of the map, and by adding italic and underline effects with the zip codes, I was able to take advantage of the principles of similarity and proximity to highlight the focus of the map, the zip codes within Hillsborough County only. White text for the zip codes worked well in terms of visibility, and black text on a white background for the title provides good contrast.\nUsing text labels for the zip codes in combination with adding a color layer that represented the ‘count’ column as a y-axis variable, allowed me to create a heat map color scheme that not only added a count legend for the number of schools per zip code but also made each zip code filled in with a variable color from green to red with the red zip code standing out from the rest and truly highlighting the zip code with the most schools. This also helped with proximity and grouping patterns to show where the school count had the most density per zip code. It displays the pattern of green zip codes surrounding the red zip code in the center, and the yellow zip codes seem to be directly north and south of the red zip code in the center.\nI chose to use a satellite image for the background, as the backgrounds with nothing but grey shading did not include enough detail, and the backgrounds with the streets and highways included too much unnecessary detail that cluttered the map. The satellite image seemed to relay the message clearly without complicating the picture."

    "text": "This is the first post in my LIS4317 Visual Analytics blog. Welcome!\nThe assignment requires an example of a data visualization and some analysis.\nHere is the example I chose:\n\nKostandi, C. (2022). World’s Population at 8 Billion People [Image]. VisualCapitalist.com. https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualized-the-worlds-population-at-8-billion/\nFor the analysis portion of the assignment:\nI believe that the data visualization was created by a human, and not by AI. My reasoning supporting this conclusion is based on the data points and how they seem to accurately quantify the populations of the countries of the world. The data may be skewed and/or biased, and the data may be incorrect or un-accurate. However, due to the fact that the visualization is published on a website, with the authors name and the date that it was created, this adds a layer of transparency and accountability to validate the research data. I dont believe that AI was used to create the visualization because the facts are clearly labeled and displayed. AI may have produced noticeable errors or facts that may seem hard to believe. The image represents truth well.\nSyllabus review:\nI confirm that I understand the course structure, grading, and peer-review process. I find it interesting that we will be required to post our assignments to various platforms / applications, and the Final Project will include a peer-review process. The weekly homework seems challenging and interesting and the grading scale is clear. I am grateful that the required texts are available for free and that we do not need to purchase any books. I am excited to learn more about the application of visual design principles and I understand how to communicate with the professor. The course expectations and rules are clearly stated in the syllabus."

    "section": "",
    "text": "This is my third post for my LIS4317 Visual Analytics blog. Welcome!\nFor this assignment, tasks #1-5, I was required to download Adobe Illustrator and open the map I created in Module 2. Then apply a Sequential color palette to highlight magnitude. I refined the original map by adding vector elements using the Shape and Graph tools. This included labels, legends, and a clear title to explain the color scale and symbols. I saved the editable file and exported a high-resolution .png image for screens.\nThis is my updated map (click the map for a larger image):\n\nTask #6\nThe color choices I made included making the water in the map a lighter blue for clarity and aesthetics. The lighter blue represents water well and matches the “light map theme” colors I chose to represent the land on the map. Using the Gestalt principle of Similarity, I chose to use light green for the areas on the map that are forest or woodland areas and tan for developed land. I started with a heat map that portrayed the zip codes with more schools as red and less schools as green, however, I switched the color theme for the zip code shapes to a sequential palette from dark blue to light blue as I felt this would represent the density better, and the other colors (green through red) would have worked better for a temperature study or visualization.\nI added a larger main title that is easier to read, and enlarged the legend with appropriate labels to communicate the meaning of the colors and symbols. The choice to keep the Zip Code boundaries outlined as county shapes follows the Gestalt principle of proximity to highlight the fact that the counties within Hillsborough County are the focus of the map, and I changed the text color to black for clarity. I also added the City names and labels along with some major roadways to give a better perspective of the area in focus.\nFinally, adding a vector graphic compass with “North” labeled on the map added the finishing touch, to clearly indicate the direction of the map and verify that the map is displayed in a specific orientation. This also helps clarify the density of the Zip Codes to present the message that the Zip Codes north and south of the Zip Code with the most schools contain more schools than those east and west of that county. 33610 has the most schools in it and that message seems clear. It is the only Zip Code with that “dark blue” color to represent the fact."

    "text": "This is my fifth post for my LIS4317 Visual Analytics blog. Welcome!\nHere is a link to my ordered bar chart visualization in Plotly:\nhttps://chart-studio.plotly.com/~robertwalsh/1/\nThis is the .png image of the visualization:\n\nThe following variables are included in my analysis from the provided .csv file:\n\n“A” (numeric observation count from 1-20)\nAverage Position\nTime\n\nI selected this data set because it was provided for us to use in the Module 5 instructions. My design helps to visualize the data set by placing the twenty observations on the x-axis as an ordered list of unique events. Then, the two main variables in focus can be measured side by side to evaluate how the measurements change simultaneously over the course of the twenty measurements/observations. This helps the viewer visualize the “Average Position” over “Time” by using a bar chart to see the numeric values labeled on the y-axis. The story that the visualization tells is that on the first observation, the position was at 0.17 when the time was zero, and over the course of the twenty observations, the position increased steadily up to 1 by 3.8 units of time. The strengths of this design lie in its ability to display colorful bars (ranking) representing data side by side and observe how they change over time. A potential weakness may be the lack of more comprehensive data or more robust events/observations.\nHere is a link to my pie chart visualization in Plotly:\nhttps://chart-studio.plotly.com/~robertwalsh/3/\nThis is the .png image of the visualization:\n\nThe same variables included in my analysis from the provided .csv file:\n\n“A” (numeric observation count from 1-20)\nAverage Position\nTime\n\nI used the same data set because it was provided for us to use in the Module 5 instructions. My design helps to visualize the data set by placing the twenty observations labeled on the right as a legend for twenty unique events. Then, the two main variables in focus can be measured in each slice to evaluate how the measurements change simultaneously over the course of time per measurement/event. This helps the viewer visualize the “Average Position” over “Time” by using a pie chart to see the numeric values for time and average position as a slice of the whole time interval 0-3.8. The story that the visualization tells is that on the first observation, the position was at 0.17 when the time was zero, and over the course of the twenty observations, 0.2 units at a time (each slice), the position increased steadily up to 1 over 3.8 units of time. The strengths of this design lie in its ability to display colorful slices (part-to-whole) representing data together to observe how they changed over time. A potential weakness may be the lack of control to change what each slice represents. The percentage was locked to represent the absolute value of the time number and I could not figure out how to specify certain time intervals for each slice, such as the percentage of time from 0-1.8, or the percentage of time that the position was between 0.17 and 0.60."
