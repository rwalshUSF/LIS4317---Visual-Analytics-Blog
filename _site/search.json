    "text": "This is my second post for my LIS4317 Visual Analytics blog. Welcome!\nThe assignment required me to perform a search using ‘Google Dataset Search’ using keywords that interest me, ensuring that the dataset included a column of complete street addresses. I chose the following keywords for my search:\n‘Hillsborough County Public School Locations’\nI chose these keywords because I wanted to create a map of Hillsborough County Public Schools that shows the zip codes with the most and least schools within them.\nHere is the dataset that I chose to use:\nhttps://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/hillsborough::schools/explore\nI was then required to open the dataset .csv file and save it as a ‘Google Sheet’ that would be saved on my ‘Google Drive.’\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12fRF6A_MnygfVKmYrZZjixUTxyqHJ8d5q1VuxemOheA/edit?gid=70990919#gid=70990919\nI then signed up and downloaded the free version of ‘Tableau Public’ and connected to my Google Drive. Doing so allowed me to utilize the dataset within Tableau to create an interactive geographical map that displayed the various zip codes in Hillsborough County, Florida, along with their boundaries and a heat map showing the number of schools operating within each zip code. Here is the map image:\n\nI faced several challenges during the process, including adding spreadsheet columns to the ‘Marks’ in Tableau and exporting the worksheet as a .png image file. I was able to research ways to drag the columns in Tableau to the various options for the ‘Marks’ and found that creating the map with ‘zipcode’ and ‘details’ worked well. I then added a label for each zip code and chose a ‘Filled Map’ style to highlight the boundaries and patterns for Hillsborough County zip codes. I was also able to research ways to export a worksheet and learned that I was not able to export the worksheet to an image from the desktop application. I needed to publish/save the project to Tableau Public online to export the map to a .png image file on my local hard drive.\nSome additional graphical elements or Gestalt principles that I applied to the finished map to improve clarity and insight were:\n\nAdjust point size and color scale. By making the font on the title and zip codes a little bigger and bold, I was able to capture the viewers attention and communicate the purpose of the map, and by adding italic and underline effects with the zip codes, I was able to take advantage of the principles of similarity and proximity to highlight the focus of the map, the zip codes within Hillsborough County only. White text for the zip codes worked well in terms of visibility, and black text on a white background for the title provides good contrast.\nUsing text labels for the zip codes in combination with adding a color layer that represented the ‘count’ column as a y-axis variable, allowed me to create a heat map color scheme that not only added a count legend for the number of schools per zip code but also made each zip code filled in with a variable color from green to red with the red zip code standing out from the rest and truly highlighting the zip code with the most schools. This also helped with proximity and grouping patterns to show where the school count had the most density per zip code. It displays the pattern of green zip codes surrounding the red zip code in the center, and the yellow zip codes seem to be directly north and south of the red zip code in the center.\nI chose to use a satellite image for the background, as the backgrounds with nothing but grey shading did not include enough detail, and the backgrounds with the streets and highways included too much unnecessary detail that cluttered the map. The satellite image seemed to relay the message clearly without complicating the picture."

    "text": "This is the first post in my LIS4317 Visual Analytics blog. Welcome!\nThe assignment requires an example of a data visualization and some analysis.\nHere is the example I chose:\n\nKostandi, C. (2022). World’s Population at 8 Billion People [Image]. VisualCapitalist.com. https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualized-the-worlds-population-at-8-billion/\nFor the analysis portion of the assignment:\nI believe that the data visualization was created by a human, and not by AI. My reasoning supporting this conclusion is based on the data points and how they seem to accurately quantify the populations of the countries of the world. The data may be skewed and/or biased, and the data may be incorrect or un-accurate. However, due to the fact that the visualization is published on a website, with the authors name and the date that it was created, this adds a layer of transparency and accountability to validate the research data. I dont believe that AI was used to create the visualization because the facts are clearly labeled and displayed. AI may have produced noticeable errors or facts that may seem hard to believe. The image represents truth well.\nSyllabus review:\nI confirm that I understand the course structure, grading, and peer-review process. I find it interesting that we will be required to post our assignments to various platforms / applications, and the Final Project will include a peer-review process. The weekly homework seems challenging and interesting and the grading scale is clear. I am grateful that the required texts are available for free and that we do not need to purchase any books. I am excited to learn more about the application of visual design principles and I understand how to communicate with the professor. The course expectations and rules are clearly stated in the syllabus."
