    "text": "This is the first post in my LIS4317 Visual Analytics blog. Welcome!\nThe assignment requires an example of a data visualization and some analysis.\nHere is the example I chose:\n\nKostandi, C. (2022). Worldâ€™s Population at 8 Billion People [Image]. VisualCapitalist.com. https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualized-the-worlds-population-at-8-billion/\nFor the analysis portion of the assignment:\nI believe that the data visualization was created by a human, and not by AI. My reasoning supporting this conclusion is based on the data points and how they seem to accurately quantify the populations of the countries of the world. The data may be skewed and/or biased, and the data may be incorrect or un-accurate. However, due to the fact that the visualization is published on a website, with the authors name and the date that it was created, this adds a layer of transparency and accountability to validate the research data. I dont believe that AI was used to create the visualization because the facts are clearly labeled and displayed. AI may have produced noticeable errors or facts that may seem hard to believe. The image represents truth well.\nSyllabus review:\nI confirm that I understand the course structure, grading, and peer-review process. I find it interesting that we will be required to post our assignments to various platforms / applications, and the Final Project will include a peer-review process. The weekly homework seems challenging and interesting and the grading scale is clear. I am grateful that the required texts are available for free and that we do not need to purchase any books. I am excited to learn more about the application of visual design principles and I understand how to communicate with the professor. The course expectations and rules are clearly stated in the syllabus."
