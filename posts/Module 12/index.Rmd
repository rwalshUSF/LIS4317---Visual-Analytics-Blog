This is post twelve for my LIS4317 Visual Analytics blog. Welcome!

For this assignment we were tasked with researching Social Network Analysis and then building/visualizing a simple un-directed social network graph using Python using nodes and edges to represent people and their connections.

I downloaded Python for Windows from their .org website and followed the instructions to install the Packages: networkx, pandas, plotnine, matplotlib.

This was completed using the cmd/command prompt window:

This worked after a failed attempt to run the "pip install networkx pandas plotnine matplotlib" command in the Python command shell, which gave me an error. A Google search of the error provided many links suggesting I run that line in the command prompt.

I then proceeded to follow the remaining instructions for the Python code:

The results were strange. The output was "\<ggplot: (640 x 480)\>" and I did not get a graph populated.

I looked up a solution online that mentioned using more code or downloading an IDE that can run a python environment and produce graphical output such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebook, however, I did not want to download extra software to my PC. I chose the suggestion generated by the Google Gemini AI Overview assistant that I could run an extra line of code to save the plot as a .png file, which worked well for this task:

plot.save("my_plot.png") \# Saves the plot as a PNG file

Here is the plot image:

Reflecting on the assignment, what worked well was downloading Python, installing packages, importing libraries, and running the python code in the python shell. What did not work as well was attempting to use Plotnine in the python shell to display the plot objects that are created. I got errors when attempting to run the "pip install networkx pandas plotnine matplotlib" command in the Python command shell, and I could not get the plot to display using the print(network_plot) function or the plt.show() function in the python command shell.

For these reasons, I would not use this method again. Maybe if I was working with Python more frequently I would download an IDE and/or applications that would enchance the Python experience. However; Rstudio is my IDE of choice, and unless Python proved capable of tasks that Rstudio could not complete, I will stick with 'R' and 'Rstudio' for my data visualizations, and future Social Network Visualization tasks as the functions seem to work better and are more user friendly.
