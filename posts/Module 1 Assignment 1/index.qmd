This is the first post in my LIS4317 Visual Analytics blog. Welcome!

The assignment requires an example of a data visualization and some analysis.

Here is the example I chose:

Kostandi, C. (2022). *Worldâ€™s Population at 8 Billion People* \[Image\]. VisualCapitalist.com. https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualized-the-worlds-population-at-8-billion/

For the analysis portion of the assignment:

I believe that the data visualization was created by a human, and not by AI.
My reasoning supporting this conclusion is based on the data points and how they seem to accurately
quantify the populations of the countries of the world. The data may be skewed and/or biased, and
the data may be incorrect or un-accurate. However, due to the fact that the visualization
is published on a website, with the authors name and the date that it was created, this adds a 
layer of transparency and accountability to validate the research data. I dont believe that AI
was used to create the visualization because the facts are clearly labeled and displayed. AI may have
produced noticeable errors or facts that may seem hard to believe. The image represents truth well.
