Welcome!\n\nFor this assignment we were tasked with exploring time series visualization methods and techniques in R Studio using the ggplot2() package and the wide range of functions that are available. We also explored videos and readings that were assigned in the module. I chose to use the 'AAPL.csv' file by Onyshchak (2020) from Kaggle.com.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Read csv file\nAAPL<-read.csv(\"AAPL.csv\")\nAAPL$Date<-as.Date(AAPL$Date)\nAAPL<-AAPL[4816:dim(AAPL)[1],]\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nAfter reading the file, I had a look at the variables.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(AAPL)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n      Date                 Open               High               Low          \n Min.   :2000-01-03   Min.   :  0.9279   Min.   :  0.9421   Min.   :  0.9086  \n 1st Qu.:2005-01-27   1st Qu.:  5.0704   1st Qu.:  5.1656   1st Qu.:  4.9830  \n Median :2010-02-18   Median : 30.1893   Median : 30.4086   Median : 29.7914  \n Mean   :2010-02-16   Mean   : 62.3735   Mean   : 62.9946   Mean   : 61.7525  \n 3rd Qu.:2015-03-11   3rd Qu.:101.5775   3rd Qu.:102.3775   3rd Qu.:100.6775  \n Max.   :2020-04-01   Max.   :324.7400   Max.   :327.8500   Max.   :323.3500  \n     Close            Adj.Close            Volume         \n Min.   :  0.9371   Min.   :  0.8135   Min.   :9.835e+06  \n 1st Qu.:  5.0586   1st Qu.:  4.3910   1st Qu.:4.678e+07  \n Median : 30.0971   Median : 26.1256   Median :8.639e+07  \n Mean   : 62.3954   Mean   : 58.6034   Mean   :1.141e+08  \n 3rd Qu.:101.6175   3rd Qu.: 94.2165   3rd Qu.:1.506e+08  \n Max.   :327.2000   Max.   :327.2000   Max.   :1.855e+09  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nI chose to use the 'Date' variable as the x-axis and the different price variables as the y-axis. Plotting the 'Open' price over time first to gain a compact description of the data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nggplot(AAPL,aes(x=Date,y=Open,group = 1))+\n  geom_line()+\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 year\", date_labels = \"%Y\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+\n  labs(title = \"AAPL Stock Price 2000-2021\",\n       x=\"Date\",\n       y=\"Opening Stock Price\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis gives a basic idea of the time series visualization of opening stock price vs. date.\nHowever, by adding a few layers, and adjusting some attributes, I was able to clean up the visualization to show a line for the changing volume in trading over time. GGplot() gives us control of the data visualization layers/attributes.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\noptions(scipen = 999)\nggplot(data = AAPL, aes(x = Date, y = Open*1000000))+\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", se = FALSE)+\n  geom_line(data = AAPL, aes(x = Date, y = Volume, color = Volume)) +\n  scale_color_gradient(low = \"green\", high = \"red\",limits=c(0,500000000))+\n  scale_x_date(date_breaks = \"1 year\", date_labels = \"%Y\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1))+\n  labs(title = \"AAPL Stock Price 2000-2021\",\n       x=\"Date\",\n       y=\"Opening Stock Price\")+\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0,500000000),\n    name = \"Volume\",\n    sec.axis = sec_axis(~ . / 1000000, name = \"Price\")\n  ) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe visualization now uses color to display annual time intervals when the trading volume is extremely high compared to the normal trading volume patterns. The graph also clearly illustrates an alarming pattern, that the stock trading volume is lower on much higher stock prices from 2014 up until 2021 which may indicate that stocks are being overpriced. This helps with the forecasting aspect of time series visualizations, a solid hypothesis would be that the price of the stock will continue to increase over the long run, however, stock prices are volatile, and susceptible to fluctuating price swings.\n\nReferences:\n\nOnyshchak, O.
