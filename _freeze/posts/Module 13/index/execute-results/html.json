Welcome!\n\nFor this assignment, we were tasked with experimenting with ChatGPT to create data visualizations and reflect on the process. We will gain hands-on experience with AI tools for visual analytics and critically assess their usefulness.\n\nTask \\# 1 - Register for ChatGPT:\n\nI did not need to register for a ChatGPT account; I could use the application as a guest.\n\nTask \\# 2 - Generate a Visualization Using ChatGPT:\n\nSelect a dataset you want to visualize.\n\nI selected the 'diamonds' dataset from 'ggplot2'\n\nThe prompt I selected for ChatGPT was explicitly designed to exploit a flaw in AI: that machines still have a hard time reasoning with ambiguity.\n\n[![](chatGPT.png)](chatGPT.png)\n\nChatGPT had no problem providing me with R code to generate a plot; However, the AI may have had trouble reasoning to determine precisely what a 'regular' person is. In this case, GPT assumed that regular people are those who can afford diamonds costing less than \\$5000, which may be biased and possibly offensive to some people.\n\nFor this reason, humans remain necessary in evaluating AI output to ensure visualizations are accurate, ethical, and meaningful.\n\nThis is the output AI generated:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis chart is not bad, but it can be improved for clarity and to avoid bias.\n\nTask \\# 3 - Customize and Refine Your Visualization:\n\nHere is a new chart. I personally refined the AI-generated code to ensure the visualization is accurate, ethical, and meaningful.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'dplyr'\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter, lag\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nThe following objects are masked from 'package:base':\n\n    intersect, setdiff, setequal, union\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Create neutral price categories\ndiamonds_price_cat <- diamonds %>%\n  mutate(\n    price_category = case_when(\n      price < 2500 ~ \"Budget (< $2,500)\",\n      price < 5000 ~ \"Mid-range ($2,500–$4,999)\",\n      price < 10000 ~ \"Premium ($5,000–$9,999)\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Luxury ($10,000+)\"\n    )\n  )\n\n# Bar chart with improved x-axis label spacing\nggplot(diamonds_price_cat, aes(x = cut, fill = price_category)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette = \"Set2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Diamonds by Cut and Price Range\",\n    subtitle = \"Exploring how diamond quality relates to price categories\",\n    x = \"Cut Quality\",\n    y = \"Number of Diamonds\",\n    fill = \"Price Range\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1, vjust = 1, size = 12),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe resulting chart is more professional, avoids uncomfortable confrontations and ethical violations, and is more accurate by inclusively providing price ranges for everyone.\n\nI then asked ChatGPT to take it a step further and modify the improved code to accommodate people who may be colorblind, further improving the visualization. This is the prompt and the final visualization:\n\n[![](chatgpt2.png)](chatgpt2.png)\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Create price categories\ndiamonds_price_cat <- diamonds %>%\n  mutate(\n    price_category = case_when(\n      price < 2500 ~ \"Budget (< $2,500)\",\n      price < 5000 ~ \"Mid-range ($2,500–$4,999)\",\n      price < 10000 ~ \"Premium ($5,000–$9,999)\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Luxury ($10,000+)\"\n    )\n  )\n\n# Define a color-blind–friendly palette (Okabe–Ito)\nokabe_ito <- c(\n  \"#E69F00\", # orange\n  \"#56B4E9\", # sky blue\n  \"#009E73\", # bluish green\n  \"#F0E442\"  # yellow\n)\n\n# Create the bar chart\nggplot(diamonds_price_cat, aes(x = cut, fill = price_category)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = okabe_ito) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Diamonds by Cut and Price Range\",\n    subtitle = \"Exploring how diamond quality relates to price categories\",\n    x = \"Cut Quality\",\n    y = \"Number of Diamonds\",\n    fill = \"Price Range\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust = 1, vjust = 1, size = 12),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)),\n    plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16),\n    legend.position = \"right\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nI was pleased with the final result! This graph suggests that there are many diamonds in a variety of cut qualities for a budget price of \\<2500 dollars, and many more options if a customer wanted to seek another price range. ChatGPT was truly a helpful collaborator in this example, and we see that humans are still necessary in the collaboration process to spot errors or bias in AI-generated visuals, and ensure visualizations are accurate, ethical, and meaningful.\n",
